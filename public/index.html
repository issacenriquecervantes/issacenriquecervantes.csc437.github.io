        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          As a <b>Graphic Communication</b> student at Cal Poly, I am passionate
          about blending aesthetic design with practical functionality to create
          meaningful user experiences. My academic journey has improved my
          ability to develop creative solutions that are both visually
          compelling and purpose-driven.
        </p>
        <p>
          With five years of freelancing experience, I’ve worked on various
          projects, including shaping the visual identity of a high school
          student store. These experiences have strengthened my technical
          proficiency, problem-solving skills, and understanding of
          user-centered design.
        </p>
        <p>
          At Cal Poly, I actively expand my expertise by combining Graphic
          Communication with a Computer Science minor, bridging design with
          technology to enhance usability and innovation. I aim to become a
          versatile designer, capable of transforming complex ideas into
          engaging, functional visuals.
        </p>
        <p>
          I thrive in collaborative environments where creativity, attention to
          detail, and strategic thinking drive impactful design. Let’s connect
          and explore how my skills and experience can bring fresh perspectives
          to the field of graphic design.
